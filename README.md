flausch-projects
================

small projects for exploring the PIC32 platform, focus on pic32mx220f032d

you can call "make" in the corresponding subdirectories

projects make use of the "flauschlib", which you can find in another
github repository. it is expected as a (git-cloned?) directory on the
same level as this "flausch-projects" directory, but that can be
configured in the default.mk file.
